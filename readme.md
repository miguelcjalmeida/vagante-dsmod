# Vagante's Dark Souls Mod (DSmod)

What about getting a character screen and plenty of fancy items in your next runs? This Mod do all that and more. 

Upon reaching the first intermission, there will be a character selection stage where you pick your initial class set ranging from knights to clerics and pyromancers. This won’t tell you how you end your adventure, being that still up to you, but surely it will give some directions. 

The character screen is optional and every player can skip it in case you feel you don’t like it. The best part is that only the host player needs to install this mod pack. The others can enjoy it with no extra cost.

Skipping the class selection or not, you still will find hundreds of amulets and rings placed on key points through all the main campaign. Be prepared because unique rooms, and special surprises awaits you.
