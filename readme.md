# Vagante's Dark Souls Alike Mod (DSAlike)

What about getting a character screen, plenty of fancy items, and a very new campaign for you and your comrades? This Mod will do all that and more. 

Upon reaching the first intermission, there will be a character selection stage where you pick your initial class among clerics, warriors, assassin, hollow and much more. This won’t tell you how you end your story, being that still up to you, but surely it will add some flavor. 

Take your chance and prepare to die once again in this difficult adventure.
